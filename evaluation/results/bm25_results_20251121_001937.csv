ask, “Am I ready for this trip?” in terms of experience, 
recency, currency, physical, and emotional condition. The 
IMSAFE checklist provides the answers.

When the descent is established and stabilized during training and practice, the descent should be terminated. In airplanes with piston 
engines, prolonged practice of emergency descents should be avoided to prevent excessive cooling of the engine cylinders. 
In-Flight Fire 
A fire in-flight demands immediate and decisive action. The pilot should be familiar with the procedures outlined to meet this 
emergency contained in the AFM/POH for the particular airplane. For the purposes of this handbook, in-flight fires are classified as 
in-flight engine fires, electrical fires, and cabin fires.

Elevator trim on many LSAs is electrically actuated with no mechanical trim adjustment available. [Figure 17-12] Depending on the 
airplane, trim position indication may be displayed on the EFIS, an LED display, or with a mechanical indicator. On electric trim 
systems, as it is with any airplane, it is important to ensure that the trim position is correctly set prior to takeoff. Because trim 
positioning/indicting systems vary widely in light-sport airplanes, pilots should fully understand not only how to position the trim, but 
also how to respond to a trim-run-away condition. Part of the preflight inspection should include actuating the trim switch in both

light control forces can result in a pilot making control deflections that exceed those necessary to compensate for the crosswind. 
Emergencies 
While an LSA is designed to be simple, a complete knowledge of its systems is needed such that a transitioning pilot is able to 
respond properly to any emergency. 
The airplane’s POH describes the appropriate responses to the various emergency situations that may be encountered. [Figure 17-16]

as a “graveyard spiral.” [Figure 17-5] This may lead to a

Somatogravic Illusion
A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff, 
stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the 
head backwards. This action may create what is known as 
the “somatogravic illusion” of being in a nose-up attitude, 
especially in conditions with poor visual references. The 
disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or 
dive attitude. A rapid deceleration by quick reduction of the 
throttle(s) can have the opposite effect, with the disoriented

Non–normal checklist use starts when the airplane flight path and configuration 
are correctly established. Only a few situations need an immediate response (such 
as CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING or Rapid Depressurization). Usually, time is 
available to assess the situation before corrective action is started. All actions must 
then be coordinated under the captain's supervision and done in a deliberate, 
systematic manner. Flight path control must never be compromised.

Emergency Descents 
An emergency descent is a maneuver for descending as rapidly as possible to a lower altitude or to the ground for an emergency 
landing. [Figure 18-6 ] The need for this maneuver may result from an uncontrollable fire, a sudden loss of cabin pressurization, or 
any other situation demanding an immediate and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the airplane as soon and as rapidly as 
possible while not exceeding any structural limitations of the airplane. Simulated emergency descents should be made in a turn to 
check for other air traffic below and to look around for a possible emergency landing area. A radio call announcing descent",0.06451612903225806,0.0,18.647058823529413

Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)
A METAR is an observation of current surface weather 
reported in a standard international format. While the 
METAR code has been adopted worldwide, each country is 
allowed to make modifications to the code. Normally, these 
differences are minor but necessary to accommodate local 
procedures or particular units of measure. This discussion of 
METAR covers elements used in the United States.
METARs are issued on a regularly scheduled basis unless 
significant weather changes have occurred. A special 
METAR (SPECI) can be issued at any time between routine 
METAR reports.

Introduction
Each aircraft comes with documentation and a set of manuals 
with which a pilot must be familiar in order to fly that aircraft. 
This chapter covers airplane flight manuals (AFM), the 
pilot’s operating handbook (POH), and aircraft documents 
pertaining to ownership, airworthiness, maintenance, and 
operations with inoperative equipment. Knowledge of these 
required documents and manuals is essential for a pilot to 
conduct a safe flight. 
Airplane Flight Manuals (AFM)
Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference 
books that provide specific information about a particular 
aircraft or subject. They contain basic facts, information,

are used to verify the aircraft instruments and systems are 
checked, set, and operating properly, as well as ensuring 
the proper procedures are performed if there is a system 
malfunction or in-flight emergency. Students reluctant to 
use checklists can be reminded that pilots at all levels of 
experience refer to checklists, and that the more advanced the 
aircraft is, the more crucial checklists become. In addition, the 
pilot’s operating handbook (POH) is required to be carried on 
board the aircraft and is essential for accurate flight planning 
and resolving in-flight equipment malfunctions. However, 
the most valuable resource a pilot has is the ability to manage

books that provide specific information about a particular 
aircraft or subject. They contain basic facts, information, 
and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an 
aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept 
on hand for ready reference.

increases in level flight, the margin between stalling speed and maneuvering speed decreases. At speeds at or below V

airplane will stall before exceeding the design load limit. 
In addition to the increased load factors, the airplane will exhibit what is called “overbanking tendency” as previously discussed in

Each airplane’s level turning performance is limited by structural and aerodynamic design, as well 
as available power. The airplane’s limiting load factor determines the maximum bank angle that can be maintained in level flight 
without exceeding the airplane’s structural limitations or stalling. As the load factor increases, so does the stalling speed. For 
example, if an airplane stalls in level flight at 50 knots, it will stall at 60 knots in a 45° steep turn while maintaining altitude. It will 
stall at 70 knots if the bank is increased to 60°. Stalling speed increases at the square root of the load factor. As the bank angle

the projection of the visual reference line to the pylon appears to pivot. Visually, a taut string, if extended from the pilot's eyes to the 
pylon, would remain parallel to lateral axis as the airplane makes a turn around the pylon. [Figure 7-12] The pivotal altitude does not 
vary with the angle of bank unless the bank is steep enough to affect the groundspeed.

An airplane typically stalls during a level, coordinated turn similar to the way it does in wings-level flight, except that the stall buffet 
can be sharper. If the turn is coordinated at the time of the stall, the airplane’s nose pitches away from the pilot just as it does in a 
wings-level stall since both wings will tend to stall nearly simultaneously. If the airplane is not properly coordinated at the time of 
stall, the stall behavior may include a change in bank angle until the AOA has been reduced. It is important to take recovery action at 
the first indication of a stall (if impending stall training/checking) or immediately after the stall has fully developed (if full stall",0.11612903225806454,0.0,15.7

the gyro remains in the plane in which it was originally

fuel weight that is a considerable part of the gross weight, and 
cruise control procedures must employ scheduled airspeed 
and power changes to maintain optimum range conditions.
The effect of altitude on the range of a propeller-driven 
aircraft is illustrated in Figure 11-13. A flight conducted at 
high altitude has a greater true airspeed (TAS), and the power 
required is proportionately greater than when conducted at 
sea level. The drag of the aircraft at altitude is the same as the 
drag at sea level, but the higher TAS causes a proportionately 
greater power required.

at a constant Mach number climb, the KCAS (and KTAS or 
KIAS as well) is falling off.
 
If the aircraft climbed high enough at this constant M
MO 
with decreasing KIAS, KCAS, and KTAS, it would begin to 
approach its stall speed. At some point, the stall speed of the 
aircraft in Mach number could equal the M
MO of the aircraft, 
and the pilot could neither slow down (without stalling) nor 
speed up (without exceeding the max operating speed of the 
aircraft). This has been dubbed the “coffin corner.”
