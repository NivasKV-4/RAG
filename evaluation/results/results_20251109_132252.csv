What are the immediate steps for an engine fire during flight?,"shut off the fuel supply to the engine by placing the mixture control in the idle cut off position and the fuel selector shutoff valve to the OFF position. The ignition switch should be left ON in order to use up the fuel that remains in the fuel lines and components between the fuel selector/shutoff valve and the engine. This procedure may starve the engine compartment of fuel and cause the fire to die naturally. If the flames are snuffed out, no attempt should be made to restart the engine. If the engine compartment fire is oil-fed, as evidenced by thick black smoke, as opposed to a fuel-fed fire, which produces bright orange flames, the pilot should consider stopping the propeller rotation by feathering or other means, such as (with constant-speed propellers) placing the pitch control lever to the minimum rpm position and raising the nose to reduce airspeed until the propeller fluid, to come in contact with a hot surface.",88.15664219856262,False,False,938,0.15384615384615385,False,0.11458333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.4074074074074074,0.031578947368421054,0.10416666666666666,E001,emergency_procedure,high

How should a pilot respond to carburetor ice indication?,"full carburetor heat should be applied immediately, and it should be left in the ON position until the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed. If detected, full carburetor heat should be applied immediately, and it should be left in the ON position until the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed. If ice is not present, the gradual increase in manifold pressure is noticed until the carburetor heat is turned off. It is imperative for a pilot to recognize carburetor ice when it forms during flight to prevent a loss in power, altitude, and/or airspeed. These symptoms may sometimes be accompanied by vibration or engine roughness. Once a power loss is carburetor heat system. Carburetor heat Carburetor heat is an anti-icing system that preheats the air before it reaches the carburetor and is intended to keep the fuel-air mixture above freezing to prevent the formation of carburetor ice.

What is the purpose of mixture control?,"decreases fuel flow, which compensates for the decreased air density at high altitude. During a descent from high altitude, the fuel-air mixture must be enriched, or it may become too lean. An overly lean mixture causes detonation, which may result in rough engine operation, overheating, and/or a loss of power. The best way to maintain the proper fuel-air mixture is to monitor the engine temperature and enrich the mixture as needed. Proper mixture control and better fuel economy for fuel-injected engines can be achieved by using an exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge. Since the process of adjusting the mixture can vary from one aircraft to another, it is important to refer to the airplane flight manual (AFM) or the POH to determine the specific procedures for a given aircraft.",74.84564328193665,False,False,787,0.2884615384615385,False,0.24203821656050953,0.14285714285714285,0.7916666666666666,0.1032258064516129,0.11464968152866241,S001,systems,medium
